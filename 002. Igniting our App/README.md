## ‚≠ê What is **Bundler**?

* A bundler in React is a tool that is used to bundle together various JavaScript, CSS, and other assets required for a web application to run in the browser. It takes multiple separate files and dependencies and combines them into a single file or multiple files that can be efficiently served to the browser.

* Bundlers are essential in modern web development because they help manage the complexity of web applications by organizing code into smaller, manageable modules, improving performance by reducing the number of requests made to the server, and optimizing assets for production deployment.

There are several bundlers commonly used in the React ecosystem, each with its own strengths and features. Here are some of the most popular types of bundlers for React:

* **Webpack**

* **Parcel**
* **Rollup**
* **Browserify**
* **Snowpack**
