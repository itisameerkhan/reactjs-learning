## ‚≠ê What is React ? 


React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where UI updates are frequent and dynamic. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update in response to data changes. It follows a component-based architecture, making it easier to manage and scale complex user interfaces. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance and supports a unidirectional data flow, providing a declarative and efficient way to build interactive UIs for web applications. Additionally, React can be seamlessly integrated with other libraries or frameworks.

## ‚≠ê Difference between a Library and Framework?

A `library` is a collection of packages that perform specific operations whereas a `framework` contains the basic flow and architecture of an application. The major difference between them is the complexity. Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code. React js is `library` and Angular is `Framework`. The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. If a `library` is used, the application calls the code from the `library`.

## ‚≠ê Why is React known as React?

React is named React because of its ability to react to changes in data. React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The name React was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner. React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community run it.

## ‚≠ê What is NPM?

It is a tool used for package management and the default package manager for Node projects. NPM is installed when NodeJS is installed on a machine. It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the online database of NPM. This database is called the NPM Registry, and it hosts public and private '`packages`.' To add or update packages, we use the NPM CLI to interact with this database.

`npm` alternative is `yarn`

How to initialize `npm`?

```
npm init
```

`npm init -y` can be used to skip the setup step, npm takes care of it and creates the package.json json file automatically , but without configurations.

nd features.

* Automatic code splitting

## ‚≠ê What is npx?

`npx` is a tool that is used to execute the packages. It comes with the npm, when you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically `npx` will installed. It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package.
