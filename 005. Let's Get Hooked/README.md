## ‚≠ê Importing and Exporting Components

### ‚ö° Exporting Components

You can export a component by placing the export keyword in front of its declaration:

```jsx
// Button.js
import React from 'react';

const Button = ({ onClick, text }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{text}</button>;
};

export default Button;
```

Alternatively, you can export components using named exports:

```jsx
// Button.js
import React from 'react';

export const Button = ({ onClick, text }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{text}</button>;
};
```

### ‚ö° Importing Components

**Default Import**

To import a component that was exported as the default export

```jsx
import Button from './Button'; // Path to the Button component
```

To import a component that was exported as a named export:

```jsx
import { Button } from './Button'; // Path to the Button component file
```

#### üíª Importing Multiple Components:

```jsx
import Button, { AnotherComponent, YetAnotherComponent } from './Components';
```

#### üíª Aliasing Imports:

You can alias imports using the `as` keyword:

```jsx
import { Button as CustomButton } from './Button';
```

#### üíª Importing All Exports:

To import all named exports from a file, you can use the * syntax:

```jsx
import * as Components from './Components';
```

#### üíª consider this example 

In this example, I want to filter out top restaurant by their average rating. If the average rating in greater than 4.5 then put the result into this `mockData`.

```jsx
import { data } from "../utils/constants";
```

```jsx
let mockData = data;
  const handleClick = () => {
    mockData = data.filter((value) => {
      return value.info.avgRating > 4.5
    });
    console.log(mockData);
};
```

```jsx
<div className="res-list">
    {mockData.map((value, index) => (
      <RestaurantCard data={value} key={index} />
    ))}
</div>
```

#### üåê Output

![demo](/assets/demo20.png)

In this output file we got the filtered result of 2 elements in an array. **but notice the UI doesn't even changed.**

In React, directly assigning a new value to a variable like `mockData = data.filter(...)` without using state does not trigger a re-render of the component. This is because React relies on state management to detect changes and re-render components accordingly.

In your example, `mockData` is a regular JavaScript variable and not part of React's state. Therefore, updating `mockData` does not inform React that the component's state has changed, and React does not re-render the component.

To update the UI in React, you need to use state management. This typically involves using `useState` hook in functional components or `setState` method in class components. When you update the state using these methods, React detects the changes and re-renders the components to reflect the updated state.

## ‚≠ê React Hooks

React hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React version 16.8 to address complex state management and lifecycle methods in functional components. Hooks provide a more concise and readable way to manage state and side effects in React applications.
