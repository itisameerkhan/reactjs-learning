## ‚≠ê Feature Overview

### ‚ö° Client Side Routing

React Router enables "**client side routing**".

In traditional websites, the browser requests a document from a web server, downloads and evaluates CSS and JavaScript assets, and renders the HTML sent from the server. When the user clicks a link, it starts the process all over again for a new page.

Client side routing allows your app to update the URL from a link click without making another request for another document from the server. Instead, your app can immediately render some new UI and make data requests with fetch to update the page with new information.

This enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for the next page. It also enables more dynamic user experiences with things like animation.

## ‚≠ê Picking a Router

## ‚ö° `createBrowserRouter`

In React Router DOM v6, `createBrowserRouter` is a function that allows you to define the routing structure and behavior for your React application. It is a part of the new Router API introduced in React Router v6, which aims to provide a more intuitive and declarative way of defining routes.

#### üíª Import the necessary functions and components

```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom"
```

#### üíª Define your route components

```jsx
import App from "App"
import About from "About"
import Contact from "Contact"
```

#### üíª Create a router object using `createBrowserRouter`

```jsx
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
  {
    path: "/contact",
    element: <Contact />,
  },
]);

```

## ‚ö° `RouterProvider`

The `RouterProvider` is a new component introduced in React Router v6 that serves as the root component for providing the routing context to your React application. It replaces the `BrowserRouter` and `HashRouter` components used in previous versions of React Router.

#### üíª Import the RouterProvider

```jsx
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';
```

#### üíª Render the RouterProvider

```jsx
root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />)
```

The `RouterProvider` component is responsible for providing the routing context to your entire application. It handles the rendering of the appropriate components based on the current URL and the defined routes.

By using the `RouterProvider`, you no longer need to manually wrap your application with `BrowserRouter` or `HashRouter`. Instead, you create a router instance with your desired routing configuration and pass it to the `RouterProvider`.

### ‚ú® The RouterProvider offers several benefits:

**Improved performance**: The new Router API in React Router v6 is designed to be more efficient and improve overall performance.

**Declarative routing**: Routes are defined as data structures, making it easier to reason about the routing logic and structure.

**Nested routes**: Nested routes can be defined more easily using the children property in the route object.

**Reduced bundle size**: The new Router API aims to reduce the overall bundle size of your application.

#### üíª code snippet

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import Header from "./components/Header";
import Body from "./components/Body";
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import About from "./components/About";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Body />
    </div>
  );
};

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
]);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(
  <RouterProvider router={appRouter} />
);
```

In this above provided code, when you visited the URL `localhost:1234/about`. we get the about page

![demo](/assets/demo38.png)

same for the contact us page, when you visited the URL `localhost:1234/contact`. we get the contact page

![demo](/assets/demo39.png)

### ‚ú® Handling random URL

but when you visit some other random page, it will give this page

![demo](/assets/demo40.png)


To fix this issue and improve UX with the help of `errorElement` prop.

In the context of `createBrowserRouter` from React Router v6, the `errorElement` prop is used to specify a React component that will be rendered when an error occurs during the rendering of the route's main component. This can be useful for displaying custom error pages or handling specific error scenarios within your application.

```jsx
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
    errorElement: <Error />, // <----- ADD THIS
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
  {
    path: "/contact",
    element: <Contact />
  }
]);
```

When you visit some other random unrelated URL you will displayed with custom error component like this

![demo](/assets/demo41.png)

### ‚ö° `useRouteError`

The `useRouteError` hook in React Router v6 is used in conjunction with the `errorElement` prop to handle errors that occur during the rendering of a specific route. It provides access to the error object and other useful information related to the error.

#### üíª Define an error component

```jsx
import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom"

const Error = () => {
  const error = useRouteError();
  console.log(error);
  return (
    <div className="error">
      <h1>OOPS! Something went wrong</h1>
      <h1>
        {error.status} {error.statusText}
      </h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Error;
```

#### üíª console

## ‚ö°Children Routes

* In React Router, child routes are nested routes defined within a parent route.

* They create a hierarchical structure for your application's navigation, allowing you to organize routes based on their relationships.

### ‚ú® Improved Navigation Organization

* Child routes make the navigation structure more apparent and easier to maintain. You can see how different components and screens are related and how users can navigate between them.

* Imagine a large e-commerce website. The root path (/) would be the parent, and child routes could be `/products`, `/cart`, `/account`, etc. This makes the navigation intuitive and reflects the relationships between these sections.

### ‚ú® Code Reusability

* Parent routes with child routes often share layout components like headers, footers, and sidebars. By keeping these components in the parent, you can avoid code duplication and maintain a consistent user experience across different sections.

### ‚ú® Dynamic Path Generation

* You can utilize parameters and wildcards within child routes to create flexible URL patterns. This allows for dynamic routing based on user input or data.

* For example, a product detail page could be defined as `/products/:productId`, where `:productId` is a parameter that captures the specific product ID from the URL.

#### üíª code snippet 

```jsx
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
    errorElement: <Error />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

## ‚ö°`<Outlet />`

An `<Outlet>` should be used in parent route elements to render their child route elements. This allows nested UI to show up when child routes are rendered. If the parent route matched exactly, it will render a child index route or nothing if there is no index route.

In React Router, the `<Outlet />` component acts as a designated placeholder within a parent route's component. It tells React Router where to render the component associated with the matched child route.

#### üíª code snippet 

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
    errorElement: <Error />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

## ‚ö° Routing different pages

In normal web application, when we required to navigate to the different page with the help of anchor tag.

```html
<a href="/about">About</a>
```

By using anchor tags, when we navigate to different route URL, our web page reloads again and again consider this example

![demo](/assets/demogif1.gif)

**But in React we need to render components according to the route URL path provided**

## ‚ö° `<Link>`

A `<Link>` is an element that lets the user navigate to another page by clicking or tapping on it. In react-router-dom, a `<Link>` renders an accessible `<a>` element with a real href that points to the resource it's linking to.

In React Router, the `<Link>` component is a navigation element that allows you to navigate between different routes or pages within your single-page application. When a user clicks on a `<Link>` component, React Router prevents the browser's default behavior of sending a request to the server and performing a full page refresh. Instead, it updates the URL in the browser's address bar and renders the appropriate component associated with the new URL, providing a smooth and efficient client-side routing experience without reloading the entire page.

#### üíª code snippet 

```jsx

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="header">
        <div className="left">
          <h1>Namaste Food</h1>
        </div>
        <div className="right">
          <p>
          <Link to={"/"}>Home</Link>
          </p>
          <p>
            <Link to={"/about"}>About us</Link>
          </p>
          <p>Contact</p>
          <p>Cart</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="header-temp"></div>
    </>
  );
};
```

## ‚ö° Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing in React Router allows you to handle URLs with dynamic segments, where parts of the URL are variable rather than fixed. This is useful for scenarios where you want to display content based on parameters passed in the URL. One common use case is displaying details for a specific item or resource, such as a user profile, product page, or restaurant details.

In React Router, dynamic segments in URLs are defined using colon (`:`) notation. For example, `/restaurants/:resId` defines a route where `:resId` is a dynamic parameter representing the ID of a restaurant.

#### üíª code snippet for dynamic routing

```jsx
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
    errorElement: <Error />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
      {
        path: "/restaurants/:resId", // <----- Dynamic routing
        element: <RestaurantMenu />
      }
    ],
  },
]);
```
